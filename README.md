# Polling in the 2020 Elections

## Introduction
For this exercise, the contemporary data science issue I decided to  
explore was polling in the 2020 election cycle. I have seen a lot of public  
outcry surrounding the polling errors which underestimated the  
performances of Donald Trump and Republican candidates in 2020 in  recent years, as well as the questioning of the efficacy of polls as a  
result. To look deeper into this issue, I will examine two news articles  
representing different perspectives on what lead to these polling errors.
## [CNN: Why The Polls Were Off in 2020](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/13/politics/democratic-pollsters-2020-analysis/index.html)

In this article, CNN analyst  Harry Enten indentifies polling inaccuracies in  
the 2020 and 2016 presidential elections are symptomatic of the  
fundamental issue that polls underrepresent non college-educated White  
voters. Enten describes this issue not as a result of poor polling methodology, but as a result of polling as a whole - as this group of  
voters not only overwhelmingly favor Republican candidates, but tend to  
have high levels of social distrust which lead them to not answer polls as  
frequently. 

I belive this presents a serious problem with pre-election polling, as it  
makes it extremely difficult to  estimate how much of the general  
population these voters represent even when there is a sufficient sample  
size when they are less likely to answer polls altogether. I also, however,  
believe that this article overstates the extent to which this impacts the  
accuracy of polls, as the pre-election polls in 2020 were not as far off as  
many media reactions made them out to be. 


## [FiveThirtyEight: Why Was The National Polling Environment So Off In 2020?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-was-the-national-polling-environment-so-off-in-2020/)
This article on FiveThirtyEight by Geoffrey Skelley takes a more nuanced  
approach to the polling inaccuracies observed in the 2020 election.  
Skelley states that while Donald Trump did outperform the projections  
set by pollsters, the polling error was only around 4 percentage points.  
While this may seem high, it is not an unprecedented degree of error, as  
we observed a similar 4-point discrepancy between the projected and  
actual results of the 2012 election.

I'm more inclined to agree with this evaluation of the 2020 election polls,  
as I feel that news outlets have exaggerated the polling errors due to the  
fact that unexpected results are percieved to be more significant than  
expected results. While we should recognize that polling as a method of  
prediction is inherently flawed as it does not give us a completely  
randomized sample of potential voters, this has, for the most part, not  
caused projections to be off by a statstically significant degree in recent  
election cycles.
